Hello I am a computer engineer major at CSUF and I plan on graduating on 2028

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1
	This was an introduction of what I would learn having the basics such as pulling up terminal and vscode, how to use git add, commit, and push and learning how to run a program, I was taught many things that I would use so much for many of my other labs with just this lab and helped me adjust to a different style of coding that I was foreign to.

Lab 4, part 2
	This was probably my most favorite lab. I enjoyed the most out of guessing the number, we used integers that I would have to use for many other labs and I got to learn how the guessing function worked with an if else statement and how it would print out high or lower if my number was wrong. I liked how simple yet informative it was and the game was pretty enjoyable which made it a lot more of a reward once I had it done.

Lab 10
	This was a really interesting lab, although it was only one part. I had a lot of fun working in this lab and making sure the code was right. I had a bit of a challenge with not only formatting but having the printing working out but after that I was able to have it work. We used a 2d vector to process the population of countries and it was interesting on countries process how much people there are on a place and use a percentage to display how much there is in total in one county such as california, their county Los Angeles would print out a exact amount and their percentage that make up in california. Ex 10,000,000 and is 25% of the population as a simplified term.
